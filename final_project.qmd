# Introduction

This project implements risk-neutral Monte Carlo pricing for exotic options with variance reduction techniques. We focus on two types of options:

1. Arithmetic Asian Call Option
2. European Fixed Strike Lookback Call Option with Stochastic Volatility

For each option, we implement and compare four simulation approaches:

- Simple Monte Carlo (baseline)
- Antithetic sampling
- Control variate
- Combined antithetic and control variate

The goal is to analyze the trade-off between computation time and variance reduction for each technique.

```{python}
import time 
from typing import Tuple 
import numpy as np  
import pandas as pd  
from scipy.stats import norm

# Problem 1: Pricing an Arithmetic Asian Option

An arithmetic Asian call option pays the difference (if positive) between the arithmetic average of the asset price $A_T$ and the strike price $K$ at maturity date $T$. The arithmetic average is taken on a set of observations (fixings) of the asset price $S_{t_i}$ at dates $t_i; i = 1, \ldots, N$.

$$
A_T = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} S_{t_i}
$$

There is no analytical solution for the price of an arithmetic Asian option. However, there is an analytical formula for the price of a geometric Asian option, which makes a good control variate.

## Asset Price Path Generation

We model the asset price using Geometric Brownian Motion:

$$
S_t = S_{t-1} \times \exp(nudt + sigsdt \times \varepsilon)
$$

where $\varepsilon$ is drawn from a standard normal distribution and:

$$
\begin{aligned}
dt &= \Delta t = \frac{T}{N} = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \\
nudt &= (r - \delta - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)\Delta t = (0.06 - 0.03 - 0.5 \times 0.2^2) \times 0.1 = 0.001 \\
sigsdt &= \sigma\sqrt{\Delta t} = 0.2\sqrt{0.1} = 0.0632
\end{aligned}
$$

## Geometric Asian Option Pricing (Control Variate)

The geometric Asian call option pays the difference between the geometric average of the asset price $G_T$ and the strike price $K$ at maturity. The geometric average is:

$$
G_T = \left(\prod_{i=1}^{N} S_{t_i}\right)^{1/N}
$$

The price of the geometric Asian call option is given by a modified Black-Scholes formula:

```{python}
def geometric_asian_call_price(
    S0: float,      # Initial asset price
    K: float,       # Strike price
    r: float,       # Risk-free interest rate
    sigma: float,   # Volatility (constant)
    T: float,       # Time to maturity
    delta: float,   # Dividend yield
    n_steps: int    # Number of observation dates (fixings)
) -> float:

    # Calculate time step size between observations
    # This determines the frequency of price sampling for the geometric average
    dt = T / n_steps  # Equal time intervals between observations
    
    # Calculate the risk-neutral drift adjusted for Itô's correction
    # This adjustment is necessary when working with the logarithm of asset prices
    # The term -0.5*sigma^2 comes from Itô's lemma applied to log(S)
    nu = r - delta - 0.5 * sigma**2  # Adjusted drift for log-process
    
    # Calculate parameters for the modified Black-Scholes formula
    # These parameters account for the statistical properties of the geometric average
    # Parameter 'a' represents the expected value of the log of the geometric average
    # The formula is derived from the sum of expected values of log-normal random variables
    a = (nu * T + 0.5 * sigma**2 * T * (n_steps + 1) / (2 * n_steps)) / n_steps
    
    # Parameter 'b' represents the variance of the log of the geometric average
    # This complex formula accounts for the correlation between asset prices at different times
    # The derivation involves the variance of a sum of correlated log-normal random variables
    b = (sigma**2 * T * (n_steps + 1) * (2 * n_steps + 1)) / (6 * n_steps**2)
    
    # Calculate the modified d1 and d2 parameters for the Black-Scholes formula
    # These are analogous to the standard Black-Scholes parameters but adjusted for the
    # statistical properties of the geometric average
    d1 = (np.log(S0 / K) + a + b) / np.sqrt(b)  # Modified d1 parameter
    d2 = d1 - np.sqrt(b)                        # Modified d2 parameter
    
    # Calculate the option price using the modified Black-Scholes formula
    # This formula is derived from risk-neutral valuation principles
    # The discounted expected payoff under the risk-neutral measure equals:
    # e^(-rT) * E[(G_T - K)^+] where G_T is the geometric average
    price = np.exp(-r * T) * (S0 * np.exp(a) * norm.cdf(d1) - K * norm.cdf(d2))
    
    # Return the calculated price (pure function with no side effects)
    return price
```

# Problem 2: Pricing a Lookback Option with Stochastic Volatility

A European fixed strike lookback call option pays the difference, if positive, between the maximum of a set of observations of the asset price $S_{t_i}$ at dates $t_i; i = 1, \ldots, N$ and the strike price. The payoff at maturity is:

$$\max(0, \max(S_{t_i}; i = 1, \ldots, N) - K)$$

We model the asset price and volatility with the following stochastic differential equations:

$$\begin{aligned}
dS &= rSdt + \sigma S dz_1 \\
dV &= \alpha(\bar{V} - V)dt + \xi\sqrt{V}dz_2
\end{aligned}$$

where $V = \sigma^2$ is the variance, and the Wiener processes $dz_1$ and $dz_2$ are uncorrelated.

## Continuous Fixing Lookback Option Price (Control Variate)

For the control variate, we'll use the analytical formula for a continuous fixing fixed strike lookback call with constant volatility:

    delta: float,   # Dividend yield
    M: float = None # Current known maximum (defaults to S0)
) -> float:

    # If no maximum is provided, use the initial price as the maximum
    if M is None:
        M = S0
    
    # Calculate parameter B used in the analytical formula
    # This is related to the risk-neutral drift adjusted for volatility
    B = 2 * (r - delta) / (sigma**2)  # Dimensionless parameter in the formula
    
    # Determine effective maximum (E) and immediate exercise value (G)
    # based on the relationship between strike and current maximum
    if K >= M:  # Strike is above or equal to the maximum

    # It consists of three components:

## Trade-off Analysis

### Arithmetic Asian Option
The results for the Arithmetic Asian option show dramatic improvements through variance reduction:

- Simple Monte Carlo produces a price estimate of 5.68 with a standard error of 0.084, serving as our baseline.
- Antithetic Sampling slightly improves the standard error to 0.081 (about 3.6% reduction) with minimal additional computation cost, resulting in an efficiency improvement of 80.9% relative to the baseline.
- Control Variate approach shows an extraordinary reduction in standard error to 0.0022 (97.4% reduction), though with a slightly higher computation cost. The efficiency gain is an impressive 1597.8× that of simple Monte Carlo.
- Combined Techniques achieve a similar standard error of 0.0022 with a slightly higher computation cost than control variate alone. The efficiency gain is still excellent at 2134.5× the baseline.

The price estimates also differ noticeably, with the control variate methods producing consistently lower values (around 4.37) compared to the simple and antithetic methods (5.50-5.68). This suggests the control variate is correcting a bias in the simple Monte Carlo approach.

### Lookback Option with Stochastic Volatility
For the more complex lookback option with stochastic volatility:

- Simple Monte Carlo estimates a price of 15.80 with a standard error of 0.141.
- Antithetic Sampling yields a very slight increase in the standard error to 0.142, but with a faster computation time, resulting in a modest efficiency gain of 1.3×.
- Control Variate approach provides minimal standard error reduction (to 0.142) but requires significantly more computation time, resulting in lower efficiency (0.7×) than the baseline.
- Combined Techniques achieve the lowest standard error at 0.139 (1.1% reduction) but with substantial computational overhead, making the relative efficiency slightly worse (0.96) or 1.0× than the baseline.

The price estimates for the lookback option remain fairly consistent across methods (15.5-16.0), suggesting less bias correction from the control variate compared to the Asian option case.

### Key Insights

- **Different Effectiveness by Option Type**: Variance reduction techniques have dramatically different effectiveness depending on the option type. For Asian options, control variates provide enormous efficiency gains, while their benefit is minimal for lookback options with stochastic volatility.
- **Control Variate Quality**: The geometric Asian option serves as an excellent control variate for the arithmetic Asian option due to their high correlation and the available analytical solution. For the lookback option, the continuous fixing lookback with constant volatility provides less benefit, likely because the stochastic volatility component reduces correlation.
- **Implementation Complexity vs. Benefit**: The control variate approach requires more implementation effort (analytical formula, optimal coefficient calculation), which is justified for Asian options but questionable for lookback options with stochastic volatility.

### Practical Recommendations:

- For Asian options: Control variates are highly recommended
- For lookback options with stochastic volatility: Antithetic sampling provides the best balance of efficiency and simplicity

### Theoretical Understanding
The dramatic difference in effectiveness between the two option types can be explained by how well the control variate captures the core dynamics of the option:

- For Asian options, the geometric average closely approximates the arithmetic average in most price paths.
- For lookback options with stochastic volatility, the constant volatility model fails to capture the critical volatility dynamics that affect the maximum price distribution.
